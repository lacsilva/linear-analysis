This is the user manual for the GLO (\underline{G}lasgow \underline{L}inear \underline{O}set) code.
API documentation can be found on the online APIDOX.
Ported to f95 by Luis Silva (lacsilva@gmail.com)

\chapter{How to use this code}

\section{DEPENDENCIES}
We use cmake version 2.6-patch 4 as the build system.
For optimisation purposes, we ship our own copy of the required lapack
subroutines and their dependencies. Specifically, we depend on the subroutine
\verb|zggev| \url{http://www.netlib.org/lapack/explore-3.1.1-html/zggev.f.html}
Online documentation can be built using doxygen $>=$ 1.6.1

\section{Compiling and installing the code}
The GLO code and utilities use the cmake build system in order to generate
native builds for *nix and Windows alike. Some features can be activated or
deactivated at compile time by passing the appropriate ``-D'' option to cmake.
Check the cmake documentation \citep{CMakeDox} for other build options.

\subsection{Building the on-line documentation}
\begin{verbatim}
$ mkdir BUILD
$ cd BUILD
$ cmake ..
$ make doc
\end{verbatim}
The code documentation can then be found by pointing a browser
to:\\
\verb|<your favorite browser> BUILD/APIDOX/index.html|

\subsection{COMPILATION}
\begin{verbatim}
$ mkdir BUILD
$ cd BUILD
$ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=.. ..
$ make && make install
\end{verbatim}
After all run successfully, binary files should be in \verb|$TOPLEVEL/bin/|.

\section{GLO}
\subsection{Before running GLO}
\label{s:runConfig}
Each run needs to be configured. Configuration is passed on the standard input
and obeys a format similar to the one shown:
\begin{verbatim}
Symmetry = 2
Calculation = 3
VariablePar = Rt
Rt = 3.0e6 
tau = 1.0e5 
Pt = 1.0 
eta = 0.35 
Le = 0.3 
Rc = 1.0e2
Truncation = 10 
m0 = 19
AbsParameterError = 1.00E-08 
RelativeGRError = 1.00E-03 
MaxIterations = 1000
StepSize = -100 
UpperLimit = 9.97e4
\end{verbatim}

Any line started with '\#' or '*' is considered a comment.
Valid key entries are described below.
\begin{itemize}
\item[Symmetry] accepts an integer describing the required equatorial symmetry for the system. Possible values are 0 for no symmetry; 1 for equatorial anti-symmetry and 2 for equatorial symmetry.
\item[Calculation] accepts an integer describing which calculation should be carried out. See section~\ref{s:possibleCalcs} for a description.
\item[VariablePar] accepts a string of at most 3 characters indicating which of the adimensional parameters should be varied in root finding calculations.
\item[Rt] accepts the value of the thermal Rayleigh number.
\item[tau] accepts the value of the Coriolis number.
\item[Pt] accepts the value o the thermal Prandtl number.
\item[eta] accepts the aspect ratio $r_i/r_o$. 
\item[Le] accepts the value of the Lewis number.
\item[Rc] accepts the value of the compositional Rayleigh number.
\item[Truncation] is an integer describing the truncation. See section~\ref{s:truncation} for a description.
\item[m0] is the azimuthal mode.
\item[AbsParameterError] is the absolute error in the parameter when a root finding is performed.
\item[RelativeGRError] is the relative growth rate error when a root finding is performed.
\item[MaxIterations] is the maximum number of iterations to be passed to the root finder.
\item[StepSize] is the step to use when other than the \verb|VariablePar| are varied.
\item[UpperLimit] is the upper limit to use when other than the \verb|VariablePar| are varied.
\end{itemize}

Possible values for \verb|VariablePar| are 'Rt', 'Rc', 'Ra', 'aa', 'tau', 'Pt', 
'Le', 'eta' and 'm0'.

Invoking the program is easy. Once compiled and installed to \verb|$PATH| just
invoke it on the command line as
\begin{verbatim}
 $ glo <input> <output>
\end{verbatim}
where \verb|<input>| is the input file name and \verb|output| is the output file
name.


\subsection{Possible calculations}
\label{s:possibleCalcs}
Several types of calculation can be performed by using different values for the 
\verb|Calculation| variable. Possible values are:
\begin{itemize}
\item{-1} Varies the thermal Rayleigh number and computes the growth rate for other parameters fixed.
\item{0} Computes the critical Thermal Rayleigh number for the onset of convections for all other parameters fixed.
\item{1} Writes the (complex) eigenvalues of the problem for fixed parameters. The real part of the eigenvalues is the frequency of oscillation of the mode. The imaginary part is the symmetric of the growth rate. Modes are sorted from highest to lowest growth rate.
\item{2} Computes the critical thermal Rayleigh number as a function of tau for all other parameters fixed.
\item{3} Computes the lowest critical thermal Rayleigh number of all m's as a function of tau for all other parameters fixed.
\item{4} Computes the eigen vector Corresponding to the critical value of Rt with all other parameters fixed.
\item{5} Computes the critical thermal Rayleigh number for a range of azimuthal wave-numbers m.
\item{6} Varies the Lewis number and computes the critical thermal Rayleigh number for fixed other parameters. This subroutine changes the module variable "Le" during execution and does not restore it at the end.
\item{7} Loops through the m's to find the critical Par and m\_c.
\item{8} Loops through the m's to find the critical Rt=Rc and m\_c. 
\end{itemize}

\section{Running CritRaEff}
The CritRaEff program is a program designed to compute the critical effective 
Rayleigh number for all $\alpha$ between $-\pi$ and $\pi$. 
\verb|CritRaEff| requires an input file formatted as a "key =  value" set of pairs.
A typical input file looks like:
\begin{verbatim}
Symmetry = 2
Calculation = 0
Ra = 3.0e6
aa = 0.0d0
tau = 1.0e5 
Pt = 1.0 
eta = 0.35 
Le = 0.3 
Truncation = 10 
m0 = 19
AbsParameterError = 1.00E-08 
RelativeGRError = 1.00E-03 
MaxIterations = 1000
StepSize = -100 
UpperLimit = 9.97e4
\end{verbatim}

The meaning of these parameters is as stated above except for \verb|Calculation|.
\verb|Calculation| can now only take the values 0 or 1 for single m or multiple 
m computations, respectively.

Invoking the program is easy. Once compiled and installed to \verb|$PATH| just
invoke it on the command line as
\begin{verbatim}
 $ CritRaEff <input> <output> [-r|-c]
\end{verbatim}
where \verb|<input>| is the input file name and \verb|output| is the output file
name. The optional parameters \verb|-r| and \verb|-c| allow to override or 
continue previously started calculations, respectively.

Calculations start from $\alpha=0$ in the direction of the positive $\alpha$. 
Once no more values of $Ra_c$ can be found in this direction, the program 
returns to $\alpha=0$ and continues the process in the direction of the 
negative $\alpha$. The program saves intermediate results every 5 steps to 
files named \verb|<output>.mmm|, where \verb|mmm| is a 3 digit integer equal to 
\verb|m0|. 

If \verb|Calculation| is equal to 0 then only the m specified by \verb|m0| is 
computed and only a \verb|<output>.mmm| is produced.  If this file already 
exists and neither \verb|-r| or \verb|-c| are passed then nothing is 
done. 

If \verb|Calculation| is equal to 1 then all the m's are calculated sequentially 
between 1 and the value specified by \verb|m0|. For each m, a 
\verb|<output>.mmm| is produced. If this file already exists and neither 
\verb|-r| or \verb|-c| are passed then the file is read and no more calculations 
are performed for that m. When all m's have been calculated or read, the minimum
$Ra_c$ is chosen for each $\alpha$ and a file \verb|<output>| is produced.

Restarting a calculation (using \verb|-c|, for ``continue'') will read 
\verb|<output>.mmm| files, if existing, and recompute any entries for which 
$Ra_c$ is higher than $10^{50}$.

Overriding a calculation (using \verb|-r|, for ``replace'')  will read 
\verb|<output>.mmm| files, if existing, and recompute all values.

\chapter{Theory}

\section{Problem set up and approximations}
\label{s:problemSetup}
We consider a spherical fluid shell of inner radius $r_i$ and outer radius
$r_o$. The shell thickness is then $d = r_o - r_i$. The shell is rotating at
constant angular velocity $\Omega$ about an axis aligned with the $z$ direction.
Boundaries are impermeable and electrically insulating. Figure~\ref{f:setup}
\begin{figure}[htb]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{figs/sphshell}
\caption{Depiction of the problem set-up.}
\label{f:setup}
\end{figure}

The fluid inside the shell is electrically and thermally conductive with
magnetic diffusivity $\lambda$ and thermal diffusivity $\kappa$, and has a
viscosity $\nu$. It is assumed to have a static thermal state described by a
radial temperature profile $T_S (r)$ that can be one of the values described in
Table~\ref{t:t_profiles}.
\begin{table}[htb]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|c|lp{0.48\textwidth}|}\hline
 Opt. & Equation & Description\\\hline
  &                          & \\
 0&$T_S(r) = T_0 + \beta(r_i r_o/r - r_i)$ & The conductive temperature
 profile used in \citep{ChristensenEtAl01}.
 \\\hline
  &                          & \\
 1&$T_S(r) = T_0 - \beta r^2/2$    & This profile closely
follows the adiabat \citep{LabrossePoirier1997,DaviesGubbins2011} and alludes to
the possibility that at least a fraction of the energy available to planetary
dynamos is due to radiogenic heat release. \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Possible temperature profiles, in K, hard-coded into GLO. First column
refers to the option values used in the code.}
\label{t:t_profiles}
\end{table}

Constants $T_0$ and $\beta$ have values that depend on the profile and can be
written, in dimensional form, as a function of the temperature at the top
($T_o$) and bottom ($T_i$) boundaries. Opt.~0 has $T_0 = T_o$ and $\beta = (T_i
-T_o)/d$ and refers to the same temperature profile used in the first dynamo
benchmark exercise \citep{ChristensenEtAl01} whereas Opt.~1 has $T_0 = (T_i
r_o^2 - T_o r_i^2)/(r_o^2 - r_i^2)$ and $\beta = (T_o - T_i)/(r_o^2 - r_i^2)$,
thus closely following an adiabatic temperature profile
\citep{LabrossePoirier1997, DaviesGubbins2011}.

\begin{figure}[htb]
\centering
 \input{figs/TemperatureProfiles.tex}
 \caption{Possible temperature profiles, in K, hard-coded into GLO.}
\end{figure}

The gravity field is described by that of a self gravitating body of constant
density, $\vec g = - d \gamma \vec r$, where $rd$ is the length of the position
vector with respect to the centre of the sphere and $\gamma$ is a constant given
in $s^{-2}$. In common with most other simulations of Earth and planetary
dynamos, we assume the Boussinesq approximation implying a constant density
$\varrho_0$ except in the gravity term where the temperature dependence is taken
into account by making it proportional to $\alpha = - ( \de\varrho/\de
T)/\varrho_0 =${\sl const}.

\section{The adimensional equations}
GLO solves a set of adimensional equations that make use of the following set of
scales. Lengths are measured in units of $d$ and times in units of $d^2 / \nu$.
The temperature is measured in units of $T^* = \beta d^2 \nu/\kappa$, the 
adiabat \citep{ArdesEtAl97}. The equations of
motion for the velocity vector $\vec u$ and the heat equation for the deviation
$\Theta$ from the radial temperature profile are then given by:
\begin{subequations}
\begin{gather}
\label{e:nonDivergence}
\nabla \cdot \vec u = 0, \qquad \nabla \cdot \vec B = 0, \\
\label{e:NavierStokes}
(\partial_t + \vec u \cdot \nabla )\vec u + \tau \vec k \times
\vec u = - \nabla \pi + R_T \Theta \vec{r} + \nabla^2 \vec u + \vec B \cdot
\nabla \vec B, \\
\label{e:temperature}
\partial_t \Theta + \vec u \cdot \nabla (\Theta+T_S) = \frac{1}{P_T} \nabla^2 \Theta.
\end{gather}
\end{subequations}
where all gradient terms in the equation of motion have been combined into
$\nabla \pi$. The dimensionless parameters in our formulation are the Rayleigh
number $R$, the Coriolis number $\tau$, the thermal Prandtl number $P_T$ and the
magnetic Prandtl number $P_m$,
\begin{equation}
R_T = \frac{\alpha \gamma d^4 T^*}{\nu^2} ,
\enspace \tau = \frac{2
\Omega d^2}{\nu} , \enspace P_T = \frac{\nu}{\kappa} , \enspace P_m =
\frac{\nu}{\lambda}.
\end{equation}

\section{Adding composition}
Two major changes had to be made in order to accommodate compositional
convection in the code. The first relates to solving a new equation for the
composition anomalies $\chi$ around a static profile of composition $C_S(r)$.
\begin{equation}
\partial_t \chi  + \vec u \cdot \nabla (\chi+C_S) = \frac{1}{P_C} \nabla^2 \chi,
\label{e:composition}
\end{equation}
This equation now depends on one parameter $P_C=\nu/D$, with $D$
being the diffusivity of the composition field.

The second change relates to the buoyancy in the Navier-Stokes equation. The
buoyancy term now reads
\begin{equation}
  R_T \Theta \vec r + R_C \chi \vec r,
\end{equation}
where $R_T$ is the usual thermal Rayleigh number and now $R_C$ is a new
compositional Rayleigh number defined as
\begin{equation}
 R_C = \frac{\alpha \gamma d^4 C^*}{\nu^2}.
\end{equation}
The value $C^*$ is a scaling for the composition anomaly that can be
chosen arbitrarily or, as is the case of the temperature, based on the profile
$C_S$.



\section{Description of the linearised system.}
\label{s:problemSetup}
We use a Galerkin method to find the critical thermal Rayleigh number and most
unstable mode for the onset of convection. The method is described in detail for
the pure thermal case by \citep{ZhangBusse87}. In our case we added one more
equation for the composition following the same decomposition. The composition
is treated as a second temperature, capable of generating buoyancy and obeying
the same static profile and boundary conditions.

We make use of the following linearised equations:
\begin{subequations}
\label{eqs:linearizedConvection}
\begin{gather}
\label{eq:NavierStokes}
\partial_t \vec u = - \tau \vec k \times \vec u - \nabla \pi + (R_t \Theta +R_c \chi )\vec r + \nabla^2 \vec u, \\
\label{eq:temperature}
\partial_t \Theta = \frac{1}{P_t}\nabla^2 \Theta + \vec r \cdot \vec u , \\
\label{eq:composition}
\partial_t \chi = \frac{1}{P_c}\nabla^2 \chi  + \vec r \cdot \vec u .
\end{gather}
\end{subequations}


Both temperatures are considered uniform and constant in time at the boundaries,
whereas the flow is taken to be stress free. Except when otherwise mentioned,
the equations are solved for a spherical shell with an inner to outer radius
ratio of $\eta=0.35$

Taking the radial component of the curl and the radial component of curls curl of
\ref{eq:NavierStokes} we obtain, respectively, the equations for the toroidal
($T(\vec r,t)$) and poloidal ($S(\vec r,t)$) scalars of the flow.

We assume that the system is at the onset of convection and so all quantities
are small oscillations around a static state. Each scalar quantity is then
assumed to obey the following ansatz in time:
\begin{equation}
 X(\vec r, t) = \tilde X(\vec r,\omega) e^{it(\omega-iGR)},
\end{equation}
where $\omega$ is the frequency of oscillation and $GR$ is a growth rate. The
system will be stable, that is, any oscillation will decay, if $GR$ is less than
or equal to zero. Any instability will grow exponentially over time otherwise.
The four scalar equations are then
\begin{subequations}
\begin{gather}
\label{eq:Poloidal}
(\nabla^2-2r\partial_r)(\nabla^2_{H} \tilde S) (i\omega +GR)= - \tau \hat r \cdot curl (\vec k \times \tilde{\vec u})  + \nabla^2_{H}(R_t \tilde\Theta +R_c \tilde\chi ) + \hat r \cdot curl (curl(\nabla^2 \tilde{\vec u})), \\
\label{eq:Toroidal}
(\nabla^2_{H} \tilde T) (i\omega +GR) = - \hat r \cdot curl (\tau \vec k \times \tilde{\vec u})  + \hat r \cdot curl (\nabla^2 \tilde{\vec u}), \\
\label{eq:temp}
\tilde \Theta (i\omega +GR) = \frac{1}{P_t}\nabla^2 \Theta + \vec r \cdot \tilde{\vec u} , \\
\label{eq:comp}
\tilde \chi  (i\omega +GR) = \frac{1}{P_c}\nabla^2 \chi  + \vec r \cdot \tilde{\vec u} .
\end{gather}
\end{subequations}

Each scalar quantity can now be expanded in terms of spherical harmonics for the
angular part. The Galerkin method consists in expanding the radial part of the
scalar quantities in terms of functions that obey the specific boundary
conditions we wish to impose.

Once this is done, we can represent the system above as an algebraic equation:
\begin{equation}
 \left[ A \right] \cdot
 \begin{bmatrix}
    \tilde s_{n,l,m}\\
    \tilde t_{n,l,m}\\
    \tilde \theta_{n,l,m}\\
    \tilde \chi_{n,l,m}
\end{bmatrix}
(i\omega +GR)  =
 \left[ B \right]
        \cdot
        \begin{bmatrix}
        \tilde s_{n,l,m}\\
        \tilde t_{n,l,m}\\
        \tilde \theta_{n,l,m}\\
        \tilde \chi_{n,l,m}
        \end{bmatrix}.
\end{equation}
$A$ and $B$ are matrices of the following form:
\begin{equation}
\left[ A \right] =
\begin{bmatrix}
\square     & \varnothing & \varnothing & \varnothing \\
\varnothing & \square     & \varnothing & \varnothing \\
\varnothing & \varnothing & \square     & \varnothing \\
\varnothing & \varnothing & \varnothing & \square \\
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation},
\begin{equation}
\left[ B \right] =
\begin{bmatrix}
\square     & \varnothing & \square     & \square     \\
\varnothing & \square     & \varnothing & \varnothing \\
\square     & \varnothing & \square     & \varnothing \\
\square     & \varnothing & \varnothing & \square     \\
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}
Where squares represent non-null blocks.
This matrix equation can then be solved for the eigenvalues $(i\omega +GR)$
using standard methods.

% \warningbox{
% At this point in time, we do not take advantage of the fact that the matrix $A$
% is diagonal by blocks and the matrix $B$ has a quite a lot of zeros. We are
% still stuck with the original code design where all the values are interleaved
% with $m$ fixed, $n$ varying faster and $l$ varying slower.
% }

We explore the effects of the adimensional parameters on the onset of convection
of the system as a whole and on specific azimuthal modes.

\section{Boundary conditions}
\label{s:boundaryConditions}
In the present version of the code boundary conditions are hard-coded.
The flow obeys, free slip, non penetration conditions and the temperature and
composition anomalies are set to zero at the boundary.
Temperature and compositional profiles are set to be nearly adiabatic with 
uniformly distributed sources.

\chapter{Discretisation and numerical methods}

\section{Poloidal/toroidal decomposition}
Being solenoidal vector fields  $\vec u$ and $\vec B$ can be represented
uniquely in terms of poloidal and toroidal components,
\begin{subequations}
\begin{gather}
\vec u = \nabla \times ( \nabla \times (v \vec r) +
         r \nabla \times ( w \vec r) \enspace , \\
\vec B = \nabla \times ( \nabla \times (h \vec r) ) +
         \nabla \times ( g \vec r) \enspace .
\end{gather}
\end{subequations}
Notice that the decomposition is different for the flow and the magnetic field.
This difference in decomposition justifies the difference in implementation of
the Laplacians, spectral-to-real and real-to-spectral transformations in the
radial direction. The difference in implementation of the flow decomposition has
its justification in that values of the flow coefficients under this expansion
are better numerically behaved \citep{Tilgner1999}.

\section{Polynomial decompositions}
\subsection{Spherical harmonic decomposition}
\label{s:SphericalHarmonicDecomp}
This being a spectral code and all, it would be nice to explain the inner works
of the code in the horizontal direction.

We use $4\pi$ normalised spherical harmonics, defined as :
\begin{equation}
 Y_\ell^m( \theta , \varphi ) =  \sqrt{{(2\ell+1) }{(\ell-m)!\over (\ell+m)!}} \, P_\ell^m ( \cos{\theta} )\, e^{i m \varphi },
\end{equation}
where $P_\ell^m ( \cos{\theta} )$ are the un-normalized Associated Legendre Polynomial
and
\begin{equation}
 \int Y_\ell^m( \theta , \varphi ) {Y^*}_\ell^m( \theta , \varphi ) \mbox{d}\Omega = 4\pi.
\end{equation}

The polynomials $\bar{P}_\ell^m ( \cos{\theta} ) = \sqrt{{(2\ell+1) }{(\ell-m)!\over (\ell+m)!}}$
are the normalised ALP, which we use throughout the code to construct the spherical harmonics.


\subsubsection{Recurrence relations for the Associated Legendre Polynomials}
\begin{align}
 (\ell-m+1)P_{\ell+1}^{m}(x) &= (2\ell+1)xP_{\ell}^{m}(x) - (\ell+m)P_{\ell-1}^{m}(x)\\
 (1-x^2)\frac{d}{dx}{P_\ell^m}(x) &= \frac1{2\ell+1}
  \left[ (\ell+1)(\ell+m)P_{\ell-1}^m(x) \right. \nonumber \\
   &\quad \left. - \ell(\ell-m+1)P_{\ell+1}^m(x) \right]
\end{align}

\subsection{Galerkin method for radial decomposition}

\section{Relationship between spectra and supercritical modes}
\label{s:spectra_defs}
In spherical geometry, we can define three types of spectrum: a spectrum in
terms of azimuthal wave number $m$, or {\em m-spectrum}, ${\cal R}_m$; a
spectrum in terms of the spherical harmonic degree $l$, or {\em l-spectrum},
${\cal R}_l$; and a spectrum in terms of the Chebychev order $n$, or
{\em n-spectrum}, ${\cal R}_n$.

For a scalar field, like the temperature or the composition, these are defined
as:
\begin{align}
{\cal R}_l & = \sum_{n=1}^{Nr_s}\sum_{m=0}^l  \\
{\cal R}_m & = \sum_{n=1}^{Nr_s}\sum_{l=m}^{Nt_s}  \\
{\cal R}_n & = \sum_{m=0}^{Np_s/2}\sum_{l=m}^{Nt_s}
\end{align}



\appendix

\chapter{Utilities}
\section{modeTracker}
\label{util:modeTracker}
In some situations, it is useful to compute the eigen values of the problem at
all parameters fixed. Reconstruction of the eigen-value as a function of one of
the parameters should then be just a matter of running GLO for different values
of that parameter. However, due to the process involved in obtaining the
eigen-values themselves, there is no guarantee that eigenvalue x at run
corresponds to the same mode as eigenvalue x at run y+1.

The mode tracker is a tool that helps reorder the eigen values for each set of
parameters such that continuity is ensured.

\section{Plotting}
A plotting utility is also provided. This program computes the critical value
of the parameter given by \verb|VariablePar| and saves either an equatorial 
or meridional slice of the required quantity in openDX \verb|.general| format.

Invoking the program is easy. On the comand line type:
\begin{verbatim}
 $ glo_compute_and_plot <in file> <domain> <quantity>
\end{verbatim}
where \verb|<domain>| can be one of 2D or 3D, and \verb|<quantity>| can be one 
of: 'UR' for the radial flow or 'SL' for the equatorial stream function
$1/r \partial v/\partial\phi$.
