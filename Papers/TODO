Maybe the best way to start is to read the Ardes paper 
http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031920196032001#
to get idea of what the code can do and try to replicate some of the Ardes 
results. Once you have an idea of how it works, we can apply it to the 
case of double-diffusive convection. I have done a linear study of 
double-diffusive convection in ANNULUS geometry, this is 
http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pepi.2011.04.007.
Do the similar results hold for a spherical shell? In particular are there 
ilands of instability etc? Can we find any interesting/relevant linear 
patterns and target the nonlinear simulations in that regime.

ri-Theta-Gamma_ro-Theta-Gamma : means that the BCs are Dirichlet(value) BC 
for temperature and concentration at both boundaries. One can also 
implement Neumann (flux) BC later.
Instructions:

1) Uncompress.

2) go to
  cd forLuisSilva/DoubleDiffConv/ri-Theta-Gamma_ro-Theta-Gamma

3) Running the script file
COM.calc.plot.ArdesFig3
  sholud compile the code and produce one of the curves in figure 3 of 
the Ardes paper.

4)  Running the script file
COM.calc.plot.ArdesFig4c
  sholud compile the code and produce a part of figure 4c of the Ardes 
paper.

5) Running the script file
COM.calc.plot
is case of double diffusive convection..
